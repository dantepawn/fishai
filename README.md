## Features

- **Stereo Camera Calibration:**  
  Functions for calibrating stereo vision systems, enabling accurate depth perception and 3D reconstruction.

- **YOLO Training Configuration:**  
  Example configuration files (`YOLO_train.yaml`, `hyp.yaml`) to facilitate training object detection models.

- **Utility Functions:**  
  General-purpose Python utilities to support computer vision workflows.
